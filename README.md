# AWS Distributed Image Processing System

A scalable distributed backend system for asynchronous image processing using Flask, AWS S3, AWS SQS, Docker, and worker-based architecture.

This project allows users to upload images through an API, process them asynchronously using background workers, and store processed images in AWS S3 buckets.

# ☁️ AWS Resources Used

| Service                 | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| AWS S3 Raw Bucket       | Store original uploaded images             |
| AWS S3 Processed Bucket | Store processed images                     |
| AWS SQS Queue           | Queue communication between API and worker |

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env` files inside both:

```text
api-service/
worker-service/
```

Add:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key

AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

AWS_REGION=your_region

S3_BUCKET_RAW=your_raw_bucket

S3_BUCKET_PROCESSED=your_processed_bucket

SQS_QUEUE_URL=your_queue_url
```

# 🧠 Image Processing Workflow

1. User uploads image through Flask API.
2. API uploads original image to AWS S3 Raw Bucket.
3. API sends image metadata to AWS SQS Queue.
4. Worker continuously listens to SQS Queue.
5. Worker downloads image from S3.
6. Worker resizes image.
7. Worker adds watermark.
8. Worker uploads processed image to Processed S3 Bucket.
9. Worker deletes processed message from SQS Queue.
